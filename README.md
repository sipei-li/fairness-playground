## Content

* `recommender.ipynb`: Notebook with a simple content-based filtering recommender and a collaborative filtering (matrix factorization) recommender on MovieLens 1M. The content-based recommender Used tf-idf to extract feature vectors from movie genres and k-NN to find recommendation lists. The collaborative filtering recommender used NMF for matrix decomposition. Also tried latent dirichlet allocation to find latent topics.
